These reports included maps showing elevation of the Danville Coal Member (Dugger Formation, Pennsylvanian). The elevation maps were based on coal-test records and interpretations of geophysical logs that are included in the files of the Indiana Geological Survey. Data points were plotted by coal geologists of the Indiana Geological Survey and elevation contours were drawn by hand. The original work maps were compiled at a scale of 0.5 inch = 1 mile (scale, 1:126,720). Following completion of the investigations, the work maps showing elevation contours were subsequently scanned and digitized, and the resulting county coverages were then compiled into a single multicounty coverage. Elevations are given in feet, and the contour interval is 20 feet. Since the completion of this shapefile, additional data on coalbed elevations in selected areas has been obtained by the Indiana Geological Survey; interested users may wish to contact the Indiana Geological Survey for information on these more up-to-date sources.",Indiana Geological Survey###Denver Harper,Indiana Geological Survey,geoscientificInformation,http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Geology/Coal_Elevation_Danville.zip###http://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Geology/Coal_Elevation_Danville/MapServer/export,,,,,,iso19139,b12775e1-0423-49e8-83f5-804eae4b51be,13563,"COAL_MINE_ENTRIES_IN: Underground Coal Mine Entrances in Indiana (Indiana Geological Survey, 1:24,000, Point Shapefile)","SW_COAL_ENTRY, the predecessor of COAL_MINE_ENTRIES_IN, is a point- based ESRI ArcView shapefile that shows the locations of underground coal mine entrances in the coal region of Indiana.

are the 435 areas from which people are elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. After the apportionment of congressional seats among the states, based on census population counts, each state is responsible for establishing CDs for the purpose of electing representatives. Each CD is to be as equal in population to all other CDs in the state as practicable. The CDs in effect at the time of Census 2000 were those of the 106th Congress, whose session began in January 1999. The boundaries were identical to those reflected in the 107th CD boundary files. The CDs for the 103rd Congress (January 1993 to 1995) were the first to reflect redistricting based on the 1990 census. The 103rd CDs remained in effect through Census 2000, except where a state initiative or a court-ordered redistricting required a change. Six states redistricted for the 104th Congress (Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, South Carolina, and Virginia), five states redistricted for the 105th Congress (Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas), and three states (New York, North Carolina, and Virginia) redistricted for the 106th Congress. In North Carolina the ""1998 Congressional Plan A"" was used for the 1998 congressional elections. It was created in response to a court ruling which held the 1997 plan, ""97 House/Senate Plan A,"" unconstitutional. These boundaries are reflected in the 106th CD boundary files. The Supreme Court has since reversed that lower court ruling and the 1997 plan, ""97 House/Senate Plan A,"" (reflected in the 107th CD boundary files) was used for the 2000 North Carolina congressional elections.

In the formulation of this data layer, historic wetlands are defined as areas where there is evidence that a wetland once existed. This evidence can be from historical map information inventories of past wetland extent or other information collected that relate directly to data on wetland filling, drainage or other modifications. Historic wetlands have been identified using several different techniques depending on the availability and type of information used to locate these areas and user needs. For example, historical maps often provide information about past wetland extent or location and can be useful tools to identify historic wetlands. Historic wetlands have been identified as polygonal data. No linear features have been included. Historic wetland polygons are not classified as wetlands and have no wetland labels or attribution.

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979).

These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of 'farmed wetlands' as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps.

The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the local-resolution NHD feature class named ""NHD_LOCALRES_AREA_IN"": ""This dataset was improved to local resolution (1:2,400) as part of the Indiana Local Resolution NHD Project. The following process is done by subbasin: high-resolution NHD geodatabase is checked out from USGS; six-acre catchment areas and streams are generated using best-available digital elevation model; areas, flowlines, and waterbodies are digitized to the 6-acre limit using the best available aerial photography, adding ftype to each feature; attributes from high-resolution NHD are conflated to the new linework; subbasin geodatabase is checked back in to USGS.. After the successful completion of the previous steps, the subbasin is downloaded from USGS; the NHDArea, NHDFlowline, and NHDWaterbody feature classes are reprojected to UTM NAD 83 Zone 16N; the reprojected NHDArea features are loaded into this dataset. DESCRIPTION FROM USGS: The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.""",U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Data author)###Indiana Department of Natural Resources (Data provider)###Chris Dintaman (Data processor)###Indiana Geographic Information Office (Data provider)###Indiana Geological Survey (Data processor),United States Geological Survey,"environment###inlandWaters###spillway###rapids###submerged stream###bridge###United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)###United States Geological Survey (USGS)###Indiana Geographic Information Office###Indiana Geological Survey (IGS)###National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)###hydrography###wash###HUC08 subbasin###ditch###waterbody###Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR)###dam###stream###inundation area###hydrology###river###weir###canal###lock chamber###local resolution (1:2,400)",http://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Hydrology/Water_Bodies_Rivers_LocalRes/MapServer/export###http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Hydrology/Water_Bodies_Rivers_LocalRes.zip,Tippecanoe County###Pulaski County###Sullivan County###Kosciusko County###Allen County###LaPorte County###Michigan###Marshall County###Daviess County###Howard County###DeKalb County###Scott County###Lake County###Posey County###Bartholomew County###Dubois County###Pike County###Orange County###Tipton County###Morgan County###Elkhart County###Porter County###Grant County###Floyd County###Adams County###Brown County###Fayette County###Putnam County###Newton County###Hendricks County###Monroe County###Fulton County###Clay County###Henry County###Madison County###Carroll County###Spencer County###Martin County###Owen County###Ohio###Starke County###Washington County###Gibson County###Shelby County###Crawford County###Noble County###Cass County###Boone County###Vermillion County###Switzerland County###Jay County###Benton County###Fountain County###St Joseph County###Ripley County###Warren County###Lagrange County###Decatur County###Rush County###Hamilton County###White County###Kentucky###Jennings County###Vanderburgh County###Greene County###Union County###Jackson County###Wabash County###Franklin County###Marion County###Perry County###Clinton County###Randolph County###Montgomery County###Wayne County###Indiana###Illinois###Warrick County###Harrison County###Lawrence County###Steuben County###Miami County###Parke County###Wells County###Clark County###Blackford County###Delaware County###Johnson County###Jefferson County###Hancock County###Knox County###Ohio County###Huntington County###Whitley County###Vigo County###Dearborn County###Jasper County,,,,,iso19139,68a6d506-b4bc-4ae8-ab50-9fa44954583e,12297,"WATERSHEDS_HUC06_USGS_IN: 6-Digit Accounting Units, Hydrologic Units, in Indiana, (Derived from US Geological Survey, 1:24,000 Polygon Shapefile)",WATERSHEDS_HUC06_USGS_IN is a polygon shapefile showing the boundaries of accounting units (HUA) in Indiana.

The file was created using 1:100,000 scale data from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), therefore, the lines remain in the NHD reaches, resulting in multiple line segments for each NRI listing. The line segments have NOT been dissolved. The start and end point of each listing segment is approximate and located by described landmarks. The following excerpt from the NPS, NRI website describes the eligibility for a river to be listed- In order to be listed on the NRI, a river must be free-flowing and possess one or more Outstandingly Remarkable Values (ORVs). Thus, the eligibility analysis consists of an examination of the river's hydrology, including any man-made alterations, and an inventory of its natural, cultural, and recreational resources. There are a variety of methods to determine whether certain resources are so unique, rare or exemplary as to make them outstandingly remarkable. The determination that a river area contains ORVs is a professional judgment on the part of the interdisciplinary study team (IDT), based on objective, scientific analysis. Input from organizations and individuals familiar with specific river resources should be sought and documented as part of the process. In order to be assessed as outstandingly remarkable, a river-related value must be a unique, rare, or exemplary feature that is significant at a comparative regional or national scale. Dictionary definitions of the words ""unique"" and ""rare"" indicate that such a value would be one that is conspicuous example from among a number of similar values that are themselves uncommon or extraordinary. Only one such value is needed for eligibility.","Bernardin, Lochmueller & Associates, Inc.

Points represent monitoring stations attributed as occuring within the state of Indiana or along the Ohio River in Kentucky, or in Illinois along Lake Michigan. Joinable tables must be utilized to access data at specific stations for specific parameters. Five tables are available - tissue residue data (tischem.dbf), sediment chemistry data (sedichem.dbf), screening value, cancer slope factors, and noncancer reference doses for chemicals (reftabl.dbf), watershed summary data (watersh.dbf), biotoxicity data (biotox.dbf). US Environmental Protection Agency BASINS metadata reports - ""This dataset describes the accumulation of chemical contaminants in river, lake, ocean, and estuary bottoms and includes a screening assessment of the potential for associated adverse effects on human and environmental health. EPA evaluated more than 21,000 sampling stations nationwide using sediment chemistry data, chemical residue levels in edible tissue of aquatic organisms, and sediment toxicity data. Of the sampling stations evaluated, 5,521 stations were classified as Tier 1 (associated adverse effects are probable), 10,401 stations were classified as Tier 2 (associated adverse effects are possible, but expected infrequently), and 5,174 stations were classified as Tier 3 (no indication of associated adverse effects). Ninety-six watersheds were identified as areas of probable concern for sediment contamination. EPA believes that these watersheds represent the highest priority for further ecotoxicological assessments, risk analysis, temporal and spatial trend assessments, contaminant source evaluation, and management action because of the preponderance of evidence in these areas (although further evaluation is necessary). Also see the related report entitled The Incidence And Severity Of Sediment Contamination In Surface Waters of the United States, Volume 1, National Sediment Quality Survey (EPA 823-R-97-006, ) that was published in September 1997. For distribution with BASINS v.2.0, the spatial attributes of the database were prepared in Arcview shape file format while selected relational attributes were prepared in Arcview DBF file format."" ""This data set provides individuals with observation level data that were used in the most geographically extensive investigation of sediment contamination ever performed in the United States.

The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the local-resolution NHD feature class named ""NHD_LOCALRES_WATERBODY_IN"": ""This dataset was improved to local resolution (1:2,400) as part of the Indiana Local Resolution NHD Project. The following process is done by subbasin: high-resolution NHD geodatabase is checked out from USGS; six-acre catchment areas and streams are generated using best-available digital elevation model; areas, flowlines, and waterbodies are digitized to the 6-acre limit using the best available aerial photography, adding ftype to each feature; attributes from high-resolution NHD are conflated to the new linework; subbasin geodatabase is checked back in to USGS.. After the successful completion of the previous steps, the subbasin is downloaded from USGS; the NHDArea, NHDFlowline, and NHDWaterbody feature classes are reprojected to UTM NAD 83 Zone 16N; the reprojected NHDArea features are loaded into this dataset. DESCRIPTION FROM USGS: The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.""",U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Data author)###Indiana Department of Natural Resources (Data provider)###Chris Dintaman (Data processor)###Indiana Geographic Information Office (Data provider)###Indiana Geological Survey (Data processor),United States Geological Survey,"environment###inlandWaters###reservoir###United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)###playa###United States Geological Survey (USGS)###Indiana Geographic Information Office###Indiana Geological Survey (IGS)###pond###water###swamp###National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)###hydrography###HUC08 subbasin###seep###ditch###waterbody###Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR)###hydrology###lake###spring###canal###marsh###local resolution (1:2,400)###artificial path",http://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Hydrology/Water_Bodies_Lakes_LocalRes/MapServer/export###http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Hydrology/Water_Bodies_Lakes_LocalRes.zip,Tippecanoe County###Pulaski County###Sullivan County###Kosciusko County###Allen County###LaPorte County###Michigan###Marshall County###Daviess County###Howard County###DeKalb County###Scott County###Lake County###Posey County###Bartholomew County###Dubois County###Pike County###Orange County###Tipton County###Morgan County###Elkhart County###Porter County###Grant County###Floyd County###Adams County###Brown County###Fayette County###Putnam County###Newton County###Hendricks County###Monroe County###Fulton County###Clay County###Henry County###Madison County###Carroll County###Spencer County###Martin County###Owen County###Ohio###Starke County###Washington County###Gibson County###Shelby County###Crawford County###Noble County###Cass County###Boone County###Vermillion County###Switzerland County###Jay County###Benton County###Fountain County###St Joseph County###Ripley County###Warren County###Lagrange County###Decatur County###Rush County###Hamilton County###White County###Kentucky###Jennings County###Vanderburgh County###Greene County###Union County###Jackson County###Wabash County###Franklin County###Marion County###Perry County###Clinton County###Randolph County###Montgomery County###Wayne County###Indiana###Illinois###Warrick County###Harrison County###Lawrence County###Steuben County###Miami County###Parke County###Wells County###Clark County###Blackford County###Delaware County###Johnson County###Jefferson County###Hancock County###Knox County###Ohio County###Huntington County###Whitley County###Vigo County###Dearborn County###Jasper County,,,,,iso19139,a92c781d-57ed-48e0-a4f4-6e0e63bae275,14394,"SINKHOLE_INVENTORY_IN_KY_2011: Sinkhole inventory for southern Indiana and northern Kentucky (Indiana Geological Survey, Point Shapefile)",This point shapefile was created to display in a geographic information system (GIS) mapped and modeled (indirectly mapped) sinkhole locations in southern Indiana and Kentucky.,Indiana Geological Survey (IGS)###United States Forest Service (USFS)###Center for Geospatial Data Analysis (CGDA)###Sally L.

The goal of this project was to use an objective, reproducible methodology to estimate groundwater recharge rates in both glaciated and driftless environments. This groundwater-recharge raster layer was developed by combining a multiple regression analysis of groundwater recharge with characteristics of near-surface geologic materials. The groundwater recharge data used in the multiple regression analysis was derived from calculations of groundwater baseflow and surface-water runoff for 279 streams in Indiana. Estimates of groundwater base flow were determined using hydrograph separation analysis (Institute of Hydrology, 1980) determined using a local-minimums approach with a recession slope test, and were converted to recharge by multiplying by using estimates of runoff following Wolock (2003). The baseflow index (BFI) provides the proportion of runoff that is assumed to be groundwater contribution, so recharge was estimated as BFI * interpolated statewide runoff (not runoff per basin). The average annual rate of groundwater recharge (in/year) was used as the dependent variable in a multiple regression analysis using ordinary least squares with several landscape and morphometric independent variables representing geologic, terrain, climate, and hydrogeologic characteristics. The regression model developed for Indiana had a global R2 value of 0.50, and the most influential variables at the 95% confidence level were: - Cumulative percent area of upstream impervious surfaces - Surface clay thickness - Percent of clay in soil - Average annual air temperature - Presence/absence of unconsolidated aquifers - Slope of ground surface - Cumulative percent area of upstream water bodies - Sand composition of water well boreholes - Cumulative percent area of upstream medium-height vegetation - Hydrologic group classification of soil (A,B,C,D - SSURGO) The regression model was used as a mapping tool to spatially distribute estimates of recharge across Indiana, incorporating details of the important landscape variables.",Indiana Geological Survey (IGS)###Center for Geospatial Data Analysis (CGDA)###Sally L.

The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries. The Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 19 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, and area boundaries.""","United States Department of Commerce, United States Census Bureau (creator)###Indiana Department of Transportation, Business Information and Technology Systems, GIS Mapping (processor)","Indiana Department of Transportation, Business Information and Technology Systems, GIS Mapping",Indiana Geological Survey (IGS)###bridge###city bridge###Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT)###TIGER/Line###county bridge###United States Department of Commerce###street segment###transportation###TIGER###street centerline###United States Census Bureau (USCB)###road###2005 TIGER/Line First Edition###transportation,http://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Infrastructure/Streets_Roads_TIGER_2005/MapServer/export###http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Infrastructure/Streets_Roads_TIGER_2005.zip,Vermillion County###Steuben County###Kosciusko County###Marshall County###Tipton County###Greene County###Huntington County###Orange County###Miami County###Franklin County###Ripley County###Warren County###Rush County###Cass County###Benton County###Newton County###LaPorte County###Lawrence County###Randolph County###Martin County###Madison County###Floyd County###Lagrange County###Blackford County###Dearborn County###Switzerland County###Knox County###Hamilton County###Union County###Wayne County###Dekalb County###Adams County###Wabash County###Monroe County###Gibson County###Marion County###Daviess County###Elkhart County###Warrick County###Grant County###Jennings County###Clay County###Vanderburgh County###Harrison County###Decatur County###Vigo County###Washington County###Lake County###Owen County###Whitley County###Bartholomew County###Putnam County###Clinton County###Carroll County###Howard County###Sullivan County###Wells County###Parke County###Porter County###Hendricks County###Fountain County###Morgan County###Spencer County###Starke County###St Joseph County###Perry County###Jay County###Fayette County###Fulton County###Ohio County###Allen County###Posey County###Jackson County###Crawford County###Tippecanoe County###Indiana###Hancock County###Boone County###Pulaski County###Montgomery County###Shelby County###Henry County###Johnson County###Jefferson County###White County###Clark County###Scott County###Delaware County###Dubois County###Pike County###Jasper County###Brown County###Noble County,,,,,iso19139,545d1cb9-e09c-4095-98fb-68442aa069a3,9748,"SCHOOLS_HAZUS_IN: Schools in Indiana, Derived from HAZUS (Federal Emergency Management Agency, Point Shapefile)","SCHOOLS_HAZUS_IN is a point shapefile that shows locations of school buildings in Indiana.

This data set was provided by IDHS in ESRI shapefile format and was named ""2008_09_20_IN_Firestations.shp."" The following is a description of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) provided by personnel of the Indiana Geographic Information Council (IGIC): ""Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) After September 11, 2001, federal decision makers needed a single place to go for geospatial data. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) stood up a tiger team to determine the type of information needed for the nations critical infrastructure and developed an acquisition strategy to provide that data to the federal community. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) Working Group provided guidance in the development of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). There are currently two different version of HSIP data: HSIP Gold and HSIP Freedom. ""HSIP Gold: Designed to combine all geospatial data, and Geospatial Intelligence products into a single, integrated database. HSIP Gold is a collection of base map layers and homeland security related geospatial data. There are many sources, including licensed commodity datasets and Federal & State agency data. The HSIP Gold data was created for Federal government homeland security and homeland defense purposes. These data are only available to state and local governments for viewing purposes across a thin client network. This is referred to as disclosure in the Federal licensing agreements with the private sector contributors. However, Federal licenses also require that in the event of declared emergencies, that the data may be released to state and local governments to support their operations. Non-government organizations can not access the HSIP Gold data. ""HSIP Freedom: NGAs goal is to provide complete datasets with no limits on distribution to state and local responders. The challenge is the private-sector license restrictions. NGA came up with different approach  HSIP Freedom where state and local government provide data to DHS or NGA, which could be improved and returned to state and locals so they can get benefit from that data. Then the states would be able to look at same data as federal government and distribute it as they see fit. ""The current emphasis of the HSIP Freedom program is on sharing and improving data to create uniform State & Federal information on: Fire Stations, EMS Stations & Ambulance Services, Police Stations, Prisons & Jails, Hospitals & Urgent Care Clinics. TechniGraphicS, Inc. (TGS) was the contractor to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for development of this HSIP Freedom data. Most improvements to date have been done by TGS telephoning local officials to verify the name, address, phone number, and geospatial location of their facilities. Geospatial location is determined by asking the local official to describe their location relative to landmarks visible in orthoimagery. TGS incorporates the improved State data into the ""License Free HSIP Freedom product and makes it available to the states. They also incorporate the improved State data into HSIP Gold and deliver it to NGA. States are encouraged to share these improved data with the U.S. Geological Survey for use in The National Map and for the new generation of graphic products being produced at USGS for emergency responders.""

This is the publication guideline for cadastral data that is intended to provide a common format and structure and content for cadastral information that can be made available across jurisdictional boundaries, providing a consistent and uniform cadastral data to meet business need that includes connections to the source information from the data stewards. The data stewards determine which data are published and should be contacted for any questions on data content or for additional information. The cadastral publication data is data provided by cadastral data producers in a standard form on a regular basis. Cadastral publication data has two primary components, land parcel data and cadastral reference data. It is important to recognize that the publication data are not the same as the operation and maintenance or production data. The production data is structured to optimize maintenance processes, is integrated with internal agency operations and contains much more detail than the publication data.

This data set has been updated using the U.S. Census Bureau's Census 2005 TIGER/Line Files (First Edition), which contain updated ZCTA's reflecting U.S. Postal Service ZIP Code changes through October, 2002. There will be no further updates of ZCTA's until required for the 2010 Census. The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs): ""ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are a new statistical entity developed by the U.S. Census Bureau for tabulating summary statistics. ZCTAs are generalized area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas. They represent either USPS five- or three-digit ZIP Code areas. ZCTAs are created based on the following criteria:  ZCTAs follow census block boundaries. The ZCTA code for each census block generally represents the majority ZIP Code of the addresses within that census block.  ZCTAs are not exact representations of the USPSs ZIP Code delivery areas.  ZCTA codes cover all land and water areas.  ZCTAs include some dedicated post office box ZIP Codes in areas served only by post office boxes.  ZCTAs representing post office box ZIP Codes generally have more than 10 addresses.  ZCTAs exclude unique, single delivery point ZIP Codes, such as those for firms and organizations.  ZCTAs are distinct from other Census Bureau statistical areas, such as census tracts, because they are not stable over time and are computer-delineated based on the location of addresses at the time of Census 2000 rather than manually delineated by local program participants or Census Bureau staff before the census.  ZCTAs are distinct from other representations of ZIP Codes because they are based on address information and ZIP Codes collected or verified during Census 2000 operations.  ZCTAs frequently cross county and place boundaries and may occasionally cross from one state into another."" For a more detailed discussion of how the U.S. Census Bureau created ZCTAs, please open one of the Adobe Acrobat files found at http://www.census.gov/geo/ZCTA/zcta.html The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source shapefile DOTGIS.ZCTA5_TIGER05_IN.SHP: ""The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries. The Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 19 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, and area boundaries.""","United States Department of Commerce, United States Census Bureau (creator)###Indiana Department of Transportation, Business Information and Technology Systems, GIS Mapping (processor)","Indiana Department of Transportation, Business Information and Technology Systems, GIS Mapping",Indiana Geological Survey (IGS)###TIGER/Line Identification Number (TLID)###ZIP Code###vector###geographic information system (GIS)###ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)###TIGER/Line###United States Department of Commerce###polygon###TIGER###United States Census Bureau (USCB)###society###boundaries,http://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Reference/Zip_Codes_USCB/MapServer/export###http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Reference/Zip_Codes_USCB.zip,Vermillion County###Steuben County###Kosciusko County###Marshall County###Tipton County###Greene County###Huntington County###Orange County###Miami County###Franklin County###Ripley County###Warren County###Rush County###Cass County###Benton County###Newton County###LaPorte County###Lawrence County###Randolph County###Martin County###Madison County###Floyd County###Lagrange County###Blackford County###Dearborn County###Switzerland County###Knox County###Hamilton County###Union County###Wayne County###Dekalb County###Adams County###Wabash County###Monroe County###Gibson County###Marion County###Daviess County###Elkhart County###Warrick County###Grant County###Jennings County###Clay County###Vanderburgh County###Harrison County###Decatur County###Vigo County###Washington County###Lake County###Owen County###Whitley County###Bartholomew County###Putnam County###Clinton County###Carroll County###Howard County###Sullivan County###Wells County###Parke County###Porter County###Hendricks County###Fountain County###Morgan County###Spencer County###Starke County###St Joseph County###Perry County###Jay County###Fayette County###Fulton County###Ohio County###Allen County###Posey County###Jackson County###Crawford County###Tippecanoe County###Indiana###Hancock County###Boone County###Pulaski County###Montgomery County###Shelby County###Henry County###Johnson County###Jefferson County###White County###Clark County###Scott County###Delaware County###Dubois County###Pike County###Jasper County###Brown County###Noble County,,,,,iso19139,a0b3c96d-663f-4ae9-93f8-1fdbca49ff5f,11380,"LANDSURVEY_SECTIONS_POLY_IN: Land Survey Lines of Indiana (Indiana Geological Survey, 1:24,000, Polygon Shapefile)","LANDSURVEY_SECTIONS_POLY_IN is a 1:24,000-scale polygon shapefile with a projection of Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) North American Datum (NAD) 1983 zone 16.",Karen K.

There are 15 categories of land use shown in this data set when the associated layer file (LAND_COVER_2006_USGS_IN.LYR) is loaded. The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the NLCD 2006: ""The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Previously, NLCD consisted of three major data releases based on a 10-year cycle. These include a circa 1992 conterminous U.S. land cover dataset with one thematic layer (NLCD 1992), a circa 2001 50-state/Puerto Rico updated U.S. land cover database (NLCD 2001) with three layers including thematic land cover, percent imperviousness, and percent tree canopy, and a 1992/2001 Land Cover Change Retrofit Product. With these national data layers, there is often a 5-year time lag between the image capture date and product release. In some areas, the land cover can undergo significant change during production time, resulting in products that may be perpetually out of date. To address these issues, this circa 2006 NLCD land cover product (NLCD 2006) was conceived to meet user community needs for more frequent land cover monitoring (moving to a 5-year cycle) and to reduce the production time between image capture and product release. NLCD 2006 is designed to provide the user both updated land cover data and additional information that can be used to identify the pattern, nature, and magnitude of changes occurring between 2001 and 2006 for the conterminous United States at medium spatial resolution. For NLCD 2006, there are 3 primary data products: 1) NLCD 2006 Land Cover map; 2) NLCD 2001/2006 Change Pixels labeled with the 2006 land cover class; and 3) NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness. Four additional data products were developed to provide supporting documentation and to provide information for land cover change analysis tasks: 4) NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change; 5) NLCD 2001/2006 Maximum Potential Change derived from the raw spectral change analysis; 6) NLCD 2001/2006 From-To Change pixels; and 7) NLCD 2006 Path/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scene pairs used to derive 2001/2006 spectral change with change pair acquisition dates and scene identification numbers included in the attribute table. In addition to the 2006 data products listed in the paragraph above, two of the original release NLCD 2001 data products have been revised and reissued. Generation of NLCD 2006 data products helped to identify some update issues in the NLCD 2001 land cover and percent developed imperviousness data products. These issues were evaluated and corrected, necessitating a reissue of NLCD 2001 data products (NLCD 2001 Version 2.0) as part of the NLCD 2006 release. A majority of NLCD 2001 updates occur in coastal mapping zones where NLCD 2001 was published prior to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) 2001 land cover products. NOAA C-CAP 2001 land cover has now been seamlessly integrated with NLCD 2001 land cover for all coastal zones. NLCD 2001 percent developed imperviousness was also updated as part of this process. Land cover maps, derivatives and all associated documents are considered ""provisional"" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. The NLCD 2006 is created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product. Questions about the NLCD 2006 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2006 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.""",Indiana Geological Survey (Digital compiler)###United States Geological Survey (Author),Indiana Geological Survey,imageryBaseMapsEarthCover###environment###imageryBaseMapsEarthCover###010###cartography###geographic information system (GIS)###raster###image###land cover###National Land Cover Data (NLCD 2006)###Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium###land use###managed land###Landsat###United States Geological Survey (USGS)###Indiana Geological Survey (IGS),http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Environment/Land_Cover_2006.zip###http://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Environment/Land_Cover_2006/MapServer/export,Vermillion County###Benton County###Kosciusko County###Jennings County###White County###Union County###Posey County###Whitley County###Franklin County###Greene County###Pike County###Wayne County###Morgan County###Jay County###Monroe County###Bartholomew County###Lagrange County###Indiana###Montgomery County###Ripley County###Pulaski County###Shelby County###Warren County###Decatur County###Spencer County###Rush County###Hancock County###Martin County###Warrick County###Steuben County###Hamilton County###Gibson County###Vigo County###Owen County###St Joseph County###Knox County###Miami County###Clark County###Dearborn County###Allen County###Marion County###Johnson County###Huntington County###Adams County###Randolph County###Howard County###Ohio County###Cass County###Tippecanoe County###Fulton County###Elkhart County###Jasper County###Switzerland County###Sullivan County###Wabash County###Orange County###Daviess County###Putnam County###Marshall County###Clinton County###Delaware County###Jefferson County###Scott County###Carroll County###LaPorte County###Porter County###Hendricks County###Floyd County###Vanderburgh County###Henry County###Brown County###Newton County###Dekalb County###Tipton County###Fountain County###Blackford County###Clay County###Perry County###Madison County###Washington County###Jackson County###Lake County###Harrison County###Starke County###Dubois County###Boone County###Noble County###Crawford County###Lawrence County###Wells County###Fayette County###Parke County###Grant County,,,,,iso19139,f302eabf-914b-44ec-8965-975a658e15ed,13852,"HOOSIER_NATL_FOREST_OWNERSHIP_IN: Hoosier National Forest Ownership and Acquirement Boundary (Hoosier National Forest, U.

These ongoing or recently completed projects, conducted in collaboration with the U.S. EPA regional offices and with state resource management agencies, involve refining ecoregions, defining subregions, and locating sets of reference sites. Designed to serve as a spatial framework for environmental resource management, ecoregions denote areas within which ecosystems (and the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources) are generally similar. The most immediate needs are to develope regional biological criteria and water quality standards and to set management goals for nonpoint source pollution. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of the patterns and the composition of biotic and abiotic phenomena that affect or reflect differences in ecosystem quality and integrity (Wiken 1986; Omernik 1987, 1995). These phenomena include geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another regardless of the hierarchical level. Because of possible confusion with other meanings of terms for different levels of ecologic regions, a Roman numeral classification scheme has been adopted for this effort. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into nine ecological regions whereas at Level II the continent is subdivided into 32 classes. Level III is the hierarchical level shown on this map. For portions of the United States the ecoregions have been further subdivided to level IV. The applications of the ecoregions are explained in Gallant et al. (1989) and in reports and publications from the state and regional projects. For additional information, contact James M.

The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2003) and . ""The NLCD 2001 is created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edgematching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. Mapping zone 60 encompasses whole or portions of several states in the mid-Atlantic region, including the states of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Questions about the NLCD mapping zone 60 can be directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at the USGS EROS Data Center (EDC), Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.""",United States Geological Survey (USGS) (Author)###Indiana Geological Survey (Digital compiler),Indiana Geological Survey,imageryBaseMapsEarthCover###environment###cartography###United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)###geographic information system (GIS)###raster###land cover###grid###ESRI grid###raster grid###Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium###land use###National Land Cover Data (NLCD 2001)###managed land###Landsat###United States Geological Survey (USGS)###Indiana Geological Survey (IGS),http://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Environment/Land_Cover_2001/MapServer/export###http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Environment/Land_Cover_2001.zip,Vermillion County###Benton County###Kosciusko County###Jennings County###White County###Union County###Posey County###Whitley County###Franklin County###Greene County###Pike County###Wayne County###Morgan County###Jay County###Monroe County###Bartholomew County###Lagrange County###Indiana###Montgomery County###Ripley County###Howard County###Pulaski County###Shelby County###Warren County###Decatur County###Spencer County###Rush County###Hancock County###Martin County###Warrick County###Steuben County###Hamilton County###Gibson County###Vigo County###Owen County###St Joseph County###Knox County###Miami County###Clark County###Dearborn County###Allen County###Marion County###Johnson County###Huntington County###Adams County###Randolph County###Ohio County###Cass County###Tippecanoe County###Fulton County###Elkhart County###Jasper County###Switzerland County###Sullivan County###Wabash County###Orange County###Daviess County###Putnam County###Marshall County###Clinton County###Delaware County###Jefferson County###Scott County###Carroll County###LaPorte County###Porter County###Hendricks County###Floyd County###Vanderburgh County###Henry County###Brown County###Newton County###Dekalb County###Tipton County###Fountain County###Blackford County###Clay County###Perry County###Madison County###Washington County###Jackson County###Lake County###Harrison County###Starke County###Dubois County###Boone County###Noble County###Crawford County###Lawrence County###Wells County###Fayette County###Parke County###Grant County,,,,,iso19139,9c17bc2e-5d66-4bf0-86c4-b25773e97e3d,12982,"LNDCV_USGS_IN: Land Cover in Indiana, Derived from the USGS, Version 06-03-99 (United States Geological Survey, 30-Meter Grid)",LNDCV_USGS_IN is a grid showing land cover data in Indiana.

As our undeveloped land continues to disappear, we recognize the need to redevelop and reuse land that may have viable buildings and infrastructure already present. The existence of buildings and infrastructure, and access to transportation resources can lower the costs to a potential developer. Redevelopment of brownfields properties benefits communities by rejuvenating vacant buildings, increasing the tax base and reducing blight. Because the potential environmental liability at these properties is unknown, prospective purchasers are unwilling to assume the risk of undetermined potential cleanup costs. Thus, the properties remain idle.

This shapefile represents the first attempt to assign reasonable NEHRP soil classifications to the geologic materials throughout Indiana. The NEHRP soil classifications are based on geologic and engineering response to earthquake-induced ground shaking. NEHRP links the physical properties of soils, such as shear strength and effect on shear-wave velocity propagation, to ensure a uniform classification for nonlithified materials in the context of their performance when subjected to seismically induced ground shaking. Ranked A through F, the correct NEHRP soil class is best determined from the average shear-wave velocity of the soil column. Attributes include the following NEHRP soil classes (Hill and Foshee, 2008, Table 1, p. 5): A - Hard rock; average shear-wave velocity greater than 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 0.08. Note that Class A is not present in Indiana. B - Rock; average shear-wave velocity 760 to 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.0. C - Hard and (or) stiff to very stiff soils, including most gravel; average shear-wave velocity 360 to 760 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.1 to 1.2. D - Sands, silts, and (or) stiff to very stiff clays, and some gravel; average shear-wave velocity 180 to 360 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 1.6. E - Small to moderate thickness (10 to 50 feet), soft to medium-stiff clay, plasticity index greater than 20, moisture greater than 40 percent; average shear-wave velocity is less than 180 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 2.5. F - Soils vulnerable to potential failure or collapse under seismic loading, including liquifiable soils, quick and sensitive clays, and collapsible, weakly cemented soils; average shear-wave velocity is not applicable; amplification factor is not applicable. The following is excerpted from Indiana Geological Survey Report of Progress 35: ""The distribution and classification of soil types are essential to understanding the response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by earthquakes. Thirty-seven shear-wave velocities were measured in soft sediments at various localities throughout Indiana, twenty-eight sites of which were measured using downhole methods in freshly augered and cased wells. Purdue University provided eight additional shear-wave profiles from eight sites in their Agricultural Centers; also included is a profile from one other site in Vanderburgh County. These data, coupled with the thickness of the unconsolidated materials, were used to determine the potential amplification of earthquake-induced ground shaking. This report begins the process of defining the response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by an earthquake having an epicenter within Indiana or nearby states. It is intended to be a tool to enhance the performance of the computer program HAZUS, developed by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to model the effects of earthquakes and to assess damage scenarios. ""Plate 1 of this report, a map of Indiana at a scale of 1:500,000 showing the predicted response of geologic materials to seismically induced ground shaking, is intended only for regional planning purposes and is not a substitute for on-site shear-wave measurements and geotechnical data.

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent.

Air Pollution Control Device: Facility that removes one or more pollutants from an exhaust stream. Examples include a baghouse or wet scrubber. Combustion Unit: Facility that burns coal, oil, or natural gas. Combustion units are used to produce either electricity, steam, hot gases, or some combination of these. Examples include a utility boiler or gas turbine. Fuel Material Location: Facility for storage of fuels shared by multiple combustion units, incinerators, or processes. Examples include oil storage tanks and larger natural gas supply lines. General Administrative Location: An administrative location is created automatically for every new air emission plant primary facility. It is used for locational data to represent the entire primary facility, instead of assigning lat/longs to each sub-facility. The General Administrative Location sub-facility may be obsolete in the future, once eFACTS allows locations at the primary level. Incinerator: Facility that destroys solid waste products using a variety of fuels. Examples include municipal waste incinerators and hospital infectious waste incinerators. Point of Air Emission: Exact location or structure from which all other air emission plant sub-facilities exhaust their emissions.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades.

One of the features of many stealth aircraft is an integrated engine that is mounted above the aircraft fuselage. The engine nozzle is often rectangular with a high aspect ratio, and exhausts onto a jet deck formed by the aircraft fuselage. This configuration allows the aircraft fuselage to shield the noise and other detectable features caused by the engine from the ground. The Northrop Grumman B2 Bomber is perhaps the most popular example of this configuration. Additionally, stealth technology combined with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's) has led to the Joint Unmanned Combat System project, or J-UCAS. Both of the aircraft in development in this project use a wall-bounded high aspect ratio nozzle for stealth purposes. While these engine configurations provide a low radar profile and reduce the noise levels on the ground, they do introduce additional considerations. Since the engine is mounted above the aircraft, the nozzle jet is wall bounded by the fuselage of the aircraft. This is known as the flight deck. The jet stream exiting the nozzle can travel at supersonic speeds and potentially generates shock or expansion waves that impinge on the surface of the deck. The oscillations of these shockwaves on the deck produce localized unsteady forces acting on the aircraft. In addition, the interaction between the high speed jet stream and the slower ambient air causes a shear layer to form from the trailing edge of the nozzle. Turbulent eddies form and increase in size as they move downstream. The interactions of the shear layer with the flight deck produce additional unsteady forces on the aircraft. This thesis presents a study to predict the forces on a flight deck caused by a high aspect ratio wall bounded nozzle using both experimental methods and numerical simulations. The experiments performed were conducted on two different nozzles with aspect ratios of 4-1 and 8-1. Several different run conditions, including subsonic, over-expanded, on-design, and under-expanded, are included to study the effects of Mach number on the unsteady pressure. An aluminum flat plate i used to represent the aft deck. The plate is instrumented with Endevco pressure transducers to capture the fluctuating pressure on the aft deck. A spectral analysis performed on the individual sensors show that the primary sources of fluctuating pressure are the shear layer along with shock-boundary layer interaction. Additional scaling with the nozzle heights are also presented. The numerical simulations were performed using a fully viscous, hybrid RANS/LES model. They were set up to match the nozzle characteristics and run conditions performed in the experiment. A detailed comparison between the unsteady pressures predicted by the computational simulations and that measured by the experiment is presented. Several discrepancies between the experimental and numerical results are the result of numerical error caused by the time marching scheme used in the simulations. A proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is introduced to further analyze the computational simulations and provide a filtering method to obtain more accurate results.

Beginning in 1998, the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, began a cooperative project aimed at collecting, archiving, and entering into standardized electronic formats, the wealth of information generated by fisheries resource management agencies and tribes throughout California. Extensive data are currently available for chinook, coho, and steelhead. Major data categories include adult abundance population estimates, actual fish and/or carcass counts, counts of fish collected at dams, weirs, or traps, and redd counts. Harvest data has been compiled for many streams, and hatchery return data has been compiled for the states mitigation facilities. A draft format has been developed for juvenile abundance and awaits final approval. This CalFish Abundance Database shapefile was generated from fully routed 1:100,000 hydrography. In a few cases streams had to be added to the hydrography dataset in order to provide a means to create shapefiles to represent abundance data associated with them. Streams added were digitized at no more than 1:24,000 scale based on stream line images portrayed in 1:24,000 Digital Raster Graphics (DRG). These features generally represent abundance counts resulting from stream surveys. The linear features in this layer typically represent the location for which abundance data records apply. This would be the reach or length of stream surveyed, or the stream sections for which a given population estimate applies. In some cases the actual stream section surveyed was not specified and linear features represent the entire stream. In many cases there are multiple datasets associated with the same length of stream, and so, linear features overlap. Please view the associated datasets for detail regarding specific features. In CalFish these are accessed through the ""link"" that is visible when performing an identify or query operation. A URL string is provided with each feature in the downloadable data which can also be used to access the underlying datasets.

NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent.

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent.

The 2005 land cover for Pennsylvania was created through a mix of interpretation of remotely sensed data and use of ancillary data sources. The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007. The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use/Land Cover system, where the more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value. Using an inside buffer of 18 meters on the Landscape Blocks a new shapefile was created in order to create a 30 meter area between the blocks to represent roads. Natural vegetation cover (Water, Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, Woody Wetland, and Emergent Wetland) from the 2005 Land Cover was reclassified and then the road buffered landscape blocks were combined with the raster to assign a value of ""0"" to areas in the natural vegetation land cover that overlap with the road buffers. Acreage of the contiguous natural vegetation was calculated and the data was reclassified based on conservation value as follows: Acreage Conservation Value 0-100 0 100-250 1 250-500 2 500-1000 3 1000-2500 4 2500-5000 5 5000-7500 6 7500-15000 7 15000-25000 8 25000-40000 9 > 40000 10 Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation.

The 2005 land cover for Pennsylvania was created through a mix of interpretation of remotely sensed data and use of ancillary data sources. The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007. The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use/Land Cover system, where the more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value. Using an inside buffer of 18 meters on the Landscape Blocks a new shapefile was created in order to create a 30 meter area between the blocks to represent roads. The road buffered landscape blocks were combined with the Forest cover (Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, and Woody Wetland) raster to assign a value of ""0"" to areas in the natural vegetation land cover that overlap with the road buffers. Using an inside buffer of 300 feet on the Forest cover (Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, and Woody Wetland) from the 2005 land cover, the interior forest raster was created. Acreage of the contiguous interior forest was calculated and the data was reclassified based on conservation value as follows: Acreage Conservation Value 0-20 0 20-100 1 100-250 2 250-500 3 500-1000 4 1000-2500 5 2500-5000 6 5000-10000 7 10000-15000 8 15000-20000 9 >20000 10 No data 0 Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation.

It was developed for the express purpose of assisting with steelhead recovery planning efforts. The distributions reported in this dataset were derived from a subset of the data contained in the Aquatic Species Observation Database (ASOD), a Microsoft Access multi-species observation data capture application. ASOD is an ongoing project designed to capture as complete a set of statewide inland aquatic vertebrate species observation information as possible. Please note: A separate distribution is available for summer-run steelhead. Contact information is the same as for the above. ASOD Observation data were used to develop a network of stream segments. These lines are developed by ""tracing down"" from each observation to the sea using the flow properties of USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) High Resolution hydrography. Lastly these lines, representing stream segments, were assigned a value of either Anad Present (Anadromous present), or Unsp Present (Unspecified O. mykiss present). The end result (i.e., this layer) consists of a set of lines representing the distribution of steelhead based on observations in the Aquatic Species Observation Database. This dataset represents stream reaches that are known or believed to be used by steelhead based on steelhead observations. Thus, it contains only positive steelhead occurrences. The absence of distribution on a stream does not necessarily indicate that steelhead do not utilize that stream. Additionally, steelhead may not be found in all streams or reaches each year. This is due to natural variations in run size, water conditions, and other environmental factors. The information in this data set should be used as an indicator of steelhead presence/suspected presence at the time of the observation as indicated by the 'Late_Yr' (Latest Year) field attribute. The line features in the dataset may not represent the maximum extent of steelhead on a stream; rather it is important to note that this distribution most likely underestimates the actual distribution of steelhead. This distribution is based on observations found in the ASOD database. The individual observations may not have occurred at the upper extent of anadromous occupation. In addition, no attempt was made to capture every observation of O. mykiss and so it should not be assumed that this dataset is complete for each stream. The distribution dataset was built solely from the ASOD observational data. No additional data (habitat mapping, barriers data, gradient modeling, etc.) were utilized to either add to or validate the data. It is very possible that an anadromous observation in this dataset has been recorded above (upstream of) a barrier as identified in the Passage Assessment Database (PAD). In the near future, we hope to perform a comparative analysis between this dataset and the PAD to identify and resolve all such discrepancies. Such an analysis will add rigor to and help validate both datasets. This dataset has recently undergone a review. Data source contributors as well as CDFG fisheries biologists were provided the opportunity to review and suggest edits or additions during the review. Initially data contributors were notified and invited to review and comment on the handling of the information that they provided. The distribution was then posted to an intranet mapping application and CDFG biologists were provided an opportunity to review and comment on the dataset. During this review, biologists were also encouraged to add new observation data. This resulting final distribution contains their suggestions and additions.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades.

It sets standards, by law for the first time, that are protective of human health and the environment, but which consider future use. It provides potential developers with clear cleanup standards based on risk, not a moving target in a negotiated agreement, and provides an end to liability when that cleanup standard is achieved. The Land Recycling Program includes four bills. Act 2, Act 3, and Act 4 were signed into law by Governor Tom Ridge on May 19, 1995. Act 6 amended Act 4 and became effective in May 2000. Act 2 of 1995 is the Land Recycling and Environmental Remediation Standards Act. This act is the primary law establishing the Land Recycling Program. It creates a realistic framework for setting cleanup standards, provides special incentives for developing abandoned sites, releases responsible parties from liability when cleanup standards are met, set deadlines for Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) action and provides funding for environmental studies and cleanups. Act 3 of 1995 is the Economic Development Agency, Fiduciary and Lender Environmental Liability Protection Act. This act limits the environmental liability of those involved in redeveloping and financing a recycled industrial site. Act 4 of 1995 is the Industrial Sites Environmental Assessment Act.

The data sets were digitized primarily from the artwork used for the 1980 ""Geologic Map of Pennsylvania"" (Berg, T. M., Edmunds, W. E., Geyer, A. R., and others, compilers, 1980, Geologic map of Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Geological Survey, 4th ser., Map 1, scale 1:250,000) and from source materials used for that map. Many of the source materials had been published as page-sized maps and were digitized from this published paper copy (Berg, T. M., and Dodge, C. M., 1981, Atlas of preliminary geologic quadrangle maps of Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Geological Survey, 4th ser., Map 61, scale approx. 1:62,500). The other source materials consist of unpublished and published maps at various scales. It was beyond the scope of the project to incorporate revisions that had been made to the geologic units since the 1980 map was compiled; however, some updates to formational contacts, faults, and dikes, as well as to geologic nomenclature and ages, were incorporated where the revisions could be easily made. The 1980 Pennsylvania state geologic map (Berg and others, 1980) shows the areal distribution of 194 bedrock geologic units. The units range in geologic age from Quaternary to Precambrian and encompass a wide variety of lithologies. The map was compiled and published in a transverse mercator projection at 1:250,000 scale. The two digital data sets include 195 geologic units, which, for the most part, closely correspond to those shown on the 1980 map. The data sets were prepared using ArcInfo software and are provided in a geographic coordinate system (units in decimal degrees). Although it is possible to portray digital data at any scale, the geologic formational contacts, faults, and dikes represented in these data sets are not intended to be used at any scale finer than 1:250,000. The polygon attributes in the data set for geologic contacts and faults include unit number, map symbol, name, age, and three lithology categories that represent the general lithologic makeup of each geologic unit. Each arc (line) in the data set is attributed as one or more of the three general categories of contact, fault, or border. Contact lines are attributed according to the type of contact shown on the 1980 map (solid, dashed, queried, or arbitrary). Fault lines are similarly attributed (solid, dashed, or queried).

NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent.

It was developed for the express purpose of assisting with steelhead recovery planning efforts. The distributions reported in this dataset were derived from a subset of the data contained in the Aquatic Species Observation Database (ASOD), a Microsoft Access multi-species observation data capture application. ASOD is an ongoing project designed to capture as complete a set of statewide inland aquatic vertebrate species observation information as possible. Please note: A separate distribution is available for winter-run steelhead. Contact information is the same as for the above. ASOD Observation data were used to develop a network of stream segments. These lines are developed by ""tracing down"" from each observation to the sea using the flow properties of USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) High Resolution hydrography. Lastly these lines, representing stream segments, were assigned a value of either Anad Present (Anadromous present). The end result (i.e., this layer) consists of a set of lines representing the distribution of steelhead based on observations in the Aquatic Species Observation Database. This dataset represents stream reaches that are known or believed to be used by steelhead based on steelhead observations. Thus, it contains only positive steelhead occurrences. The absence of distribution on a stream does not necessarily indicate that steelhead do not utilize that stream. Additionally, steelhead may not be found in all streams or reaches each year. This is due to natural variations in run size, water conditions, and other environmental factors. The information in this data set should be used as an indicator of steelhead presence/suspected presence at the time of the observation as indicated by the 'Late_Yr' (Latest Year) field attribute. The line features in the dataset may not represent the maximum extent of steelhead on a stream; rather it is important to note that this distribution most likely underestimates the actual distribution of steelhead. This distribution is based on observations found in the ASOD database. The individual observations may not have occurred at the upper extent of anadromous occupation. In addition, no attempt was made to capture every observation of O. mykiss and so it should not be assumed that this dataset is complete for each stream. The distribution dataset was built solely from the ASOD observational data. No additional data (habitat mapping, barriers data, gradient modeling, etc.) were utilized to either add to or validate the data. It is very possible that an anadromous observation in this dataset has been recorded above (upstream of) a barrier as identified in the Passage Assessment Database (PAD). In the near future, we hope to perform a comparative analysis between this dataset and the PAD to identify and resolve all such discrepancies. Such an analysis will add rigor to and help validate both datasets. This dataset has recently undergone a review. Data source contributors as well as CDFG fisheries biologists have been provided the opportunity to review and suggest edits or additions during a recent review. Data contributors were notified and invited to review and comment on the handling of the information that they provided. The distribution was then posted to an intranet mapping application and CDFG biologists were provided an opportunity to review and comment on the dataset. During this review, biologists were also encouraged to add new observation data. This resulting final distribution contains their suggestions and additions.

The network of observatories, linked through common instrumentation, data access, and operation, form a ""shared"" facility and as such provide an important means of building science community. Data from the observatories provide the underpinning for much of the science supported by AfricaArray. Some of the observatories are permanent, while others are installed and operated on a temporary basis. The scientific observatories are built around broadband seismic stations for recording earthquakes. The reason for this is because the initial focus of AfricaArray was in geophysics. The goal during the first phase of AfricaArray (2005-2007) was to establish a network of 20 to 30 permanent observatories spanning much of southern and eastern Africa. The placement of permanent observatories in many countries was governed by the location of existing seismic stations. Seismic equipment at many of these stations has been upgraded, the data have been formatted uniformly and archived, and access to the data has been streamlined.

The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007. The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use/Land Cover system, where the more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value. Using an inside buffer of 18 meters on the Landscape Blocks a new shapefile was created in order to create a 30 meter area between the blocks to represent roads. Grasslands vegetation cover (Pasture/Grass) from the 2005 land cover was reclassified and then the road buffered landscape blocks were combined with the raster to assign a value of ""0"" to areas in the Grasslands land cover that overlap with the road buffers.

Beginning in 1998, the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, began a cooperative project aimed at collecting, archiving, and entering into standardized electronic formats, the wealth of information generated by fisheries resource management agencies and tribes throughout California. Extensive data are currently available for chinook, coho, and steelhead. Major data categories include adult abundance population estimates, actual fish and/or carcass counts, counts of fish collected at dams, weirs, or traps, and redd counts. Harvest data has also been compiled for many streams. This CalFish Abundance Database shapefile was generated from fully routed 1:100,000 hydrography. In a few cases streams had to be added to the hydrography dataset in order to provide a means to create shapefiles to represent abundance data associated with them. Streams added were digitized at no more than 1:24,000 scale based on stream line images portrayed in 1:24,000 Digital Raster Graphics (DRG). These features represent abundance information resulting from counts at weirs, fish ladders, or other point-type monitoring protocols such as beach seining. The point features in this layer typically represent the location for which abundance data records apply. In many cases there are multiple datasets associated with the same point location, and so, point features overlap. Please view the associated datasets for detail regarding specific features. In CalFish these are accessed through the ""link"" field that is visible when performing an identify or query operation. A URL string is provided with each feature in the downloadable data which can also be used to access the underlying datasets.

NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true.

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent.

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades.

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades.

One of the features of many stealth aircraft is an integrated engine that is mounted above the aircraft fuselage. The engine nozzle is often rectangular with a high aspect ratio, and exhausts onto a jet deck formed by the aircraft fuselage. This configuration allows the aircraft fuselage to shield the noise and other detectable features caused by the engine from the ground. The Northrop Grumman B2 Bomber is perhaps the most popular example of this configuration. Additionally, stealth technology combined with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's) has led to the Joint Unmanned Combat System project, or J-UCAS. Both of the aircraft in development in this project use a wall-bounded high aspect ratio nozzle for stealth purposes. While these engine configurations provide a low radar profile and reduce the noise levels on the ground, they do introduce additional considerations. Since the engine is mounted above the aircraft, the nozzle jet is wall bounded by the fuselage of the aircraft. This is known as the flight deck. The jet stream exiting the nozzle can travel at supersonic speeds and potentially generates shock or expansion waves that impinge on the surface of the deck. The oscillations of these shockwaves on the deck produce localized unsteady forces acting on the aircraft. In addition, the interaction between the high speed jet stream and the slower ambient air causes a shear layer to form from the trailing edge of the nozzle. Turbulent eddies form and increase in size as they move downstream. The interactions of the shear layer with the flight deck produce additional unsteady forces on the aircraft. This thesis presents a study to predict the forces on a flight deck caused by a high aspect ratio wall bounded nozzle using both experimental methods and numerical simulations. The experiments performed were conducted on two different nozzles with aspect ratios of 4-1 and 8-1. Several different run conditions, including subsonic, over-expanded, on-design, and under-expanded, are included to study the effects of Mach number on the unsteady pressure. An aluminum flat plate i used to represent the aft deck. The plate is instrumented with Endevco pressure transducers to capture the fluctuating pressure on the aft deck. A spectral analysis performed on the individual sensors show that the primary sources of fluctuating pressure are the shear layer along with shock-boundary layer interaction. Additional scaling with the nozzle heights are also presented. The numerical simulations were performed using a fully viscous, hybrid RANS/LES model. They were set up to match the nozzle characteristics and run conditions performed in the experiment. A detailed comparison between the unsteady pressures predicted by the computational simulations and that measured by the experiment is presented. Several discrepancies between the experimental and numerical results are the result of numerical error caused by the time marching scheme used in the simulations. A proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is introduced to further analyze the computational simulations and provide a filtering method to obtain more accurate results.

The permitted LOD can include erosion & sedimentation measures that do not impact surface vegetation (such as silt sock). LOC typically include the area where gas infrastructure is developed such as roads, pads and pipelines and the additional workspace cleared for the project. Shale gas related development projects tend to be adjacent to each other and could possibly be attributed to several types of development (pads, roads, pipelines). The individual features have been arbitrarily assigned to a single type of development to avoid counting the same areas several times. Portions of the LOC may be reclaimed or allowed to revert back to natural vegetation within the near future, and is therefore not necessarily an accurate measure of vegetated areas permanently converted to non-vegetation.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades.

NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades.

Almost 33,000 polygons make up the coverage, each with map unit description and physiognomic attribute information. The database provides crosswalk information to all USNVC floristic and physiognomic levels and several other classification systems (ecological groups/subgroups, Minnesota communities, NW Ontario forest and wetland ecosystems, USGS land use/land cover). A total of 50 USNVC associations make up the vegetation at Voyageurs National Park and environs. With all vegetation types, land use classes, and park specific categories combined, a total of 67 map units define the ground features within the project area. Applicable physiognomic modifiers define each vegetation map unit in more detail about the vegetation structure within a polygon (density, pattern, height, dominance). The spatial database was produced from the interpretation of fall 1995 and 1996 1:15,840-scale color infrared (CIR) aerial photographs. The interpreted data were transferred and automated using base maps produced from USGS digital orthophoto quadrangles (DOQ's) or using Ontario Basic Mapping Series (OBM) topographic maps.

In the first phase, a preliminary surficial deposit map was made using soil mapping (Grubb, 1986), surficial deposit mapping (Denny and Lyford, 1963), bedrock mapping (Sherwood and Platt, 1880; Sevon, 1977), and landform analysis using the 1:24,000-scale topographic map and aerial photographs. In the second phase, the preliminary surficial deposit map was verified and/or corrected during twenty person-days or so of field work. Two undergraduate geologic field assistants, Stephanie Jones and Christopher Guise, were responsible for much of the field mapping. Christopher Guise was responsible for most of southern two-thirds of the map that lies south of Loyalsock Creek, an area largely occupied by State Gamelands. Stephanie Jones was responsible for most of the northern one-third of the map, the area lying north of Loyalsock Creek. Duane Braun, surficial geology mapper, spot checked the work of the field assistants across the entire map and directly mapped the eastern end of the Bernice Coal Basin and the southwestern corner of the map within the Painter Den hunting club lands. In the third phase, the field verified/corrected preliminary surficial geology map was finalized, drafted onto three mylar overlays (contacts, isochores, and labels - rock outcrops), and had a text added by Duane Braun. In the fourth phase, the mylar overlays were scanned, digitized, and produced in Adobe PDF and ArcGIS formats by Pennsylvania Geologic Survey personnel. The distribution and type of units on the preliminary surficial geology map is primarily a combined parent material and topographic position classification of the soil survey map units. The classification of all soil series by surficial deposit map unit is given in Table 1. Many soil series are common to more than one surficial deposit type. The landform of a specific area is used to decide which surficial deposit type the soil series is most likely related to at that site on the preliminary surficial geology map. The soil series boundaries are manually transferred from the 1:20,000-scale soil survey maps to the 1:24,000-scale topographic map. During the field verification and correction phase many contacts are moved to reflect conditions directly observed in the field. Positions of the boundary lines are estimated by eye using natural and human features that are identifiable on both the soil survey aerial photographs and the topographic map. At some sites a GPS unit was used to better local a contact or feature. Expectable line location error is on the order of 50 to 100 feet on the ground where there are distinct features to guide line placement. Where boundaries cross large featureless areas of forest, line placement error is in the range of 100 feet and occasionally as much as 200 feet on the ground.","Dr. Duane D.

This data set has been updated using the U.S. Census Bureau's Census 2005 TIGER/Line Files (First Edition), which contain updated ZCTA's reflecting U.S. Postal Service ZIP Code changes through October, 2002. There will be no further updates of ZCTA's until required for the 2010 Census. The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs): ""ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are a new statistical entity developed by the U.S. Census Bureau for tabulating summary statistics. ZCTAs are generalized area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas. They represent either USPS five- or three-digit ZIP Code areas. ZCTAs are created based on the following criteria:  ZCTAs follow census block boundaries. The ZCTA code for each census block generally represents the majority ZIP Code of the addresses within that census block.  ZCTAs are not exact representations of the USPSs ZIP Code delivery areas.  ZCTA codes cover all land and water areas.  ZCTAs include some dedicated post office box ZIP Codes in areas served only by post office boxes.  ZCTAs representing post office box ZIP Codes generally have more than 10 addresses.  ZCTAs exclude unique, single delivery point ZIP Codes, such as those for firms and organizations.  ZCTAs are distinct from other Census Bureau statistical areas, such as census tracts, because they are not stable over time and are computer-delineated based on the location of addresses at the time of Census 2000 rather than manually delineated by local program participants or Census Bureau staff before the census.  ZCTAs are distinct from other representations of ZIP Codes because they are based on address information and ZIP Codes collected or verified during Census 2000 operations.  ZCTAs frequently cross county and place boundaries and may occasionally cross from one state into another."" For a more detailed discussion of how the U.S. Census Bureau created ZCTAs, please open one of the Adobe Acrobat files found at http://www.census.gov/geo/ZCTA/zcta.html The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source shapefile DOTGIS.ZCTA5_TIGER05_IN.SHP: ""The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries. The Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 19 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, and area boundaries.""","United States Department of Commerce, United States Census Bureau (creator)###Indiana Department of Transportation, Business Information and Technology Systems, GIS Mapping (processor)","Indiana Department of Transportation, Business Information and Technology Systems, GIS Mapping",Indiana Geological Survey (IGS)###TIGER/Line Identification Number (TLID)###ZIP Code###vector###geographic information system (GIS)###ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)###TIGER/Line###United States Department of Commerce###polygon###TIGER###United States Census Bureau (USCB)###society###boundaries,http://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Reference/Zip_Codes_USCB/MapServer/export###http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Reference/Zip_Codes_USCB.zip,Vermillion County###Steuben County###Kosciusko County###Marshall County###Tipton County###Greene County###Huntington County###Orange County###Miami County###Franklin County###Ripley County###Warren County###Rush County###Cass County###Benton County###Newton County###LaPorte County###Lawrence County###Randolph County###Martin County###Madison County###Floyd County###Lagrange County###Blackford County###Dearborn County###Switzerland County###Knox County###Hamilton County###Union County###Wayne County###Dekalb County###Adams County###Wabash County###Monroe County###Gibson County###Marion County###Daviess County###Elkhart County###Warrick County###Grant County###Jennings County###Clay County###Vanderburgh County###Harrison County###Decatur County###Vigo County###Washington County###Lake County###Owen County###Whitley County###Bartholomew County###Putnam County###Clinton County###Carroll County###Howard County###Sullivan County###Wells County###Parke County###Porter County###Hendricks County###Fountain County###Morgan County###Spencer County###Starke County###St Joseph County###Perry County###Jay County###Fayette County###Fulton County###Ohio County###Allen County###Posey County###Jackson County###Crawford County###Tippecanoe County###Indiana###Hancock County###Boone County###Pulaski County###Montgomery County###Shelby County###Henry County###Johnson County###Jefferson County###White County###Clark County###Scott County###Delaware County###Dubois County###Pike County###Jasper County###Brown County###Noble County,,,,,iso19139,2cf3079e-d603-41c4-85c8-4432acab890a,10121,"LANDSURVEY_COUNTY_POLY_IN: County Boundaries of Indiana (Indiana Geological Survey, 1:24,000, Polygon Shapefile)","LANDSURVEY_COUNTY_POLY_IN is a 1:24,000-scale polygon shapefile with a projection of Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) North American Datum (NAD) 1983 zone 16.",Karen K.

In the first phase, a preliminary surficial deposit map was made using soil mapping (Grubb, 1986), surficial deposit mapping (Denny and Lyford, 1963), bedrock mapping (Sherwood and Platt, 1880; Sevon, 1977), and landform analysis using the 1:24,000-scale topographic map and aerial photographs. In the second phase, the preliminary surficial deposit map was verified and/or corrected during twenty person-days or so of field work. Two undergraduate geologic field assistants, Stephanie Jones and Christopher Guise, were responsible for much of the field mapping. Christopher Guise was responsible for most of southern two-thirds of the map that lies south of Loyalsock Creek, an area largely occupied by State Gamelands. Stephanie Jones was responsible for most of the northern one-third of the map, the area lying north of Loyalsock Creek. Duane Braun, surficial geology mapper, spot checked the work of the field assistants across the entire map and directly mapped the eastern end of the Bernice Coal Basin and the southwestern corner of the map within the Painter Den hunting club lands. In the third phase, the field verified/corrected preliminary surficial geology map was finalized, drafted onto three mylar overlays (contacts, isochores, and labels - rock outcrops), and had a text added by Duane Braun. In the fourth phase, the mylar overlays were scanned, digitized, and produced in Adobe PDF and ArcGIS formats by Pennsylvania Geologic Survey personnel. The distribution and type of units on the preliminary surficial geology map is primarily a combined parent material and topographic position classification of the soil survey map units. The classification of all soil series by surficial deposit map unit is given in Table 1. Many soil series are common to more than one surficial deposit type. The landform of a specific area is used to decide which surficial deposit type the soil series is most likely related to at that site on the preliminary surficial geology map. The soil series boundaries are manually transferred from the 1:20,000-scale soil survey maps to the 1:24,000-scale topographic map. During the field verification and correction phase many contacts are moved to reflect conditions directly observed in the field. Positions of the boundary lines are estimated by eye using natural and human features that are identifiable on both the soil survey aerial photographs and the topographic map. At some sites a GPS unit was used to better local a contact or feature. Expectable line location error is on the order of 50 to 100 feet on the ground where there are distinct features to guide line placement. Where boundaries cross large featureless areas of forest, line placement error is in the range of 100 feet and occasionally as much as 200 feet on the ground.","Dr. Duane D.

A Coal Mining Operation is a DEP primary facility type related to the Mining Program.

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials.

Air Pollution Control Device: Facility that removes one or more pollutants from an exhaust stream. Examples include a baghouse or wet scrubber. Combustion Unit: Facility that burns coal, oil, or natural gas. Combustion units are used to produce either electricity, steam, hot gases, or some combination of these. Examples include a utility boiler or gas turbine. Fuel Material Location: Facility for storage of fuels shared by multiple combustion units, incinerators, or processes. Examples include oil storage tanks and larger natural gas supply lines. General Administrative Location: An administrative location is created automatically for every new air emission plant primary facility. It is used for locational data to represent the entire primary facility, instead of assigning lat/longs to each sub-facility. The General Administrative Location sub-facility may be obsolete in the future, once eFACTS allows locations at the primary level. Incinerator: Facility that destroys solid waste products using a variety of fuels. Examples include municipal waste incinerators and hospital infectious waste incinerators. Point of Air Emission: Exact location or structure from which all other air emission plant sub-facilities exhaust their emissions. Examples may include a steel or masonry smokestack; however, a point of air emission may also represent fugitive emissions that escaped from other points of a facility. Process: Facility that produces or modifies a product, and creates an air emission from either the materials used or a fuel consumed. Examples include coating lines or cement kilns.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades.

describing changes in the factors that are hypothesized to enhance student performance by improving achievement on standardized examinations and promoting student engagement and the development of 21st Century knowledges and skills. This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades. For more information on the EETT component of the evaluation please click here for a press release about the EETT Evaluation.

Air Emissions Plant is a DEP primary facility type related to the Air Quality Program. The sub-facility types related to the Air Emissions Plant that are included are: Air Pollution Control Device, Combustion Unit, Fuel Material Location, General Administrative Location, Incinerator, Point of Air Emission, and Process. Air Pollution Control Device: Facility that removes one or more pollutants from an exhaust stream. Examples include a baghouse or wet scrubber. Combustion Unit: Facility that burns coal, oil, or natural gas. Combustion units are used to produce either electricity, steam, hot gases, or some combination of these. Examples include a utility boiler or gas turbine. Fuel Material Location: Facility for storage of fuels shared by multiple combustion units, incinerators, or processes. Examples include oil storage tanks and larger natural gas supply lines. General Administrative Location: An administrative location is created automatically for every new air emission plant primary facility. It is used for locational data to represent the entire primary facility, instead of assigning lat/longs to each sub-facility. The General Administrative Location sub-facility may be obsolete in the future, once eFACTS allows locations at the primary level. Incinerator: Facility that destroys solid waste products using a variety of fuels. Examples include municipal waste incinerators and hospital infectious waste incinerators. Point of Air Emission: Exact location or structure from which all other air emission plant sub-facilities exhaust their emissions. Examples may include a steel or masonry smokestack; however, a point of air emission may also represent fugitive emissions that escaped from other points of a facility. Process: Facility that produces or modifies a product, and creates an air emission from either the materials used or a fuel consumed. Examples include coating lines or cement kilns. Continuous Emission Monitoring Point: Devices attached to smokestacks that monitor specific pollutants, i.e. sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, etc.",Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection,Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection,"environment###efacts, AEP, Air Emission Plant, Air",http://www.pasda.psu.edu/,Pennsylvania,,,,,iso19139,72abbc3f-b759-411c-8adf-a253d59e5044,13014,Australian Fish Species Distribution Maps,"This dataset is a series of GIS maps of fish species distributions around Australia.
